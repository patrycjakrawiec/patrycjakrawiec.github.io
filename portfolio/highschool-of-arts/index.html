      <h3>HIGH SCHOOL OF ART</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>The idea for the project came out from the element which is directly connected with the main theme of the design, arts: a painting. Each painting has few composition plans and due to their qualities (size, number of elements, colour intensity etc.) they’re more or less noticeable for an observer. If we like to place this in space, foreground is the closest to an observer, second, third plan.. are further. That’s why the shape of the building consists of two parts: core which is a frame of a ’painting’ and attached to the core overhanging cubics which are in the foreground, second, third.. plan of the 'painting'.</p>

      <p>The building is designed as an infill building and attached to old tenement house. The usage of glass and concrete on the elevation makes it fit into surroundings and colourful glasses in windows indicate the artistic profile of the school.<br>
      As for the function, the communication part is located in the core of the building, while classrooms, offices etc. are in the overhanging part. In the main part there are designed social spaces where students can spend their time during breaks. Classrooms are spacious and light.<br>
      The building's construction is steel frame designed in modular system.</p>
